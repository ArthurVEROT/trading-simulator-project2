# API Trading simulator

## About the project
This project has been developed by Arthur VEROT & Pierre CARETTE.
During our training at Ironhack, we had to realize an API. We chose to build an API to run a [paper trading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_simulator) app. On this app you can trade over 100 cryptos and 12 000 stocks. To achieve that, we used the Binance and IEX API.

## Tech stack
NodeJS | ExpressJS | MongoDB | Mongoose

## Features  
On our app, just like a classic paper trading app, you can **buy** ðŸ“ˆ stocks/cryptos and **sell** ðŸ“‰ them.

## Postman documentation
To use our API, you can refer to our postman documentation ðŸ“œ.
